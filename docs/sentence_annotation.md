# Annotation Instructions for Teaching Reviews  

These instructions are designed to help you consistently annotate teaching reviews with the following labels: Positive, Negative, Neutral, Mixed, Unsure, and Suggestion.   

 

## Labels and Their Definitions 

1. Positive 

   Use this label for comments that express a positive sentiment about the class or the professor. These comments typically highlight good aspects or strengths. 

   Examples:  

   - " Abe is a practical, passionate, and thoughtful teacher." 

   - " Professor Abe was an absolute blessing to have as we transitioned to online learning." 
 

2. Negative 

   Use this label for comments that express a negative sentiment about the teaching or the professor.  

   Examples: 

   - " I am struggling in this class." 

   - " My first course was with Abe and it was a big disappointment " 

  

3. Mixed 

   Apply the Mixed label when different parts of the sentence express different sentiments or suggestions. Use the “Mixed” label plus the other labels that reflect the mixture. 

   Example: 

   - " I liked the individual projects a lot, but I think if they are individual projects we should probably present them as such rather than group presentations. (positive, mixed, suggestion) 
 

4. Unsure 

   If you are unsure about the sentiment but have an idea of possible sentiments, use Unsure along with other labels. There is a prior step, sentence segmentation, which may lead to incomplete sentences, so if the sentence looks cut off so that it is hard to understand, use “Unsure”.  If possible, use the “Mixed” label plus the other labels that reflect the uncertain possibilities. 


   Example: 

   - If unsure whether a sentence is positive or negative, you might annotate it as "Positive, Unsure" or "Negative, Unsure." 


5. Neutral  

   Use this label for explanations/personal background/comments. 

   Example: 

   - “I do tend to learn slower than my peers”
  

6. Suggestion 

   Use this label for comments that provide suggestions for improvement.   

   Examples: 

   - " I've given my suggestion that the course material should be \"flipped\"" 

   - " Have you ever considered a separate lab? " 

  

## Notes: 

1. Handling Implications 

Annotate based on the surface meaning of the comment, not on implied or inferred meanings. This approach ensures consistency. 

Example:  

- For "His teaching improved toward the end of the semester," annotate as Positive because the surface sentiment is positive, even if it implies previous negative performance. 

 

2. Consistency 

Always aim for consistency in applying these guidelines. 

 
3.Surface Sentiment  

Focus on the surface sentiment and avoid inferring deeper meanings unless explicitly stated. 


4. Context 

Even though the sentences may be shown in order, try to use just the context of the current sentence to choose the label. 

 
## Prodigy annotation tool 

We are using Prodigy for the annotation interface.  You will select the best label or labels and then click “Accept”. Don’t worry about the other options (“Reject”, “Ignore”). 

When annotating, remember to periodically save your work. You save the work by clicking on the floppy disk icon in the top left. If you haven’t saved annotations, you can change them using the “history” in the left menu.  

Once you get going with annotations, you may want to consider using Prodigy’s keyboard shortcuts, which can be found here https://prodi.gy/docs/api-web-app
