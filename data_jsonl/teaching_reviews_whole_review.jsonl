You come across as very nice and lenient grading, and your teaching style was good at the start of the class, but as the material got more difficult it seemed you faltered more during the lectures going over the slides. If you struggle with explaining this content to us, then we will also struggle. I feel like my knowledge of the most difficult content is shaky. Following along with your thought process as you solve a problem, only to have you get the wrong answer and backpedal, made it hard to develop the correct way to approach a problem, ie requiring knowledge of the answer beforehand. I suggest getting more familiar with these slides, or if they are not your own slides, making your own set as a fresh start.", "meta": {"filename": "201940SEIS631-01.txt", "linenum": 0}}
{"text": "I give this professor a lot of credit for choosing a solid text, responding quickly to questions via a variety of forms of communication, and for soliciting and acting on feedback to improve his class. He's approachable, knowledgeable and I believe he cares about the success of his students. Unfortunately, like so many classes in the grad software program, this class is characterized by: 1. An assignment to read a chapter 2. A class session spent going over PowerPoint slides that reiterate what was in the chapter but without bringing focus or clarity to the material 3. A smallish assignment that checks the box for \"hands on work\" 4. Two massive tests that comprise 60-80% of the grade (60% in this particular class) I believe this class, like so many others in the grad software program, would benefit from being flipped. Lectures should be viewed in video form outside of class while class time should be spent doing hands on work or exercise problems with the professor present to guide and assist. This hands on work should highlight the most important material from the book and ideally would reiterate concepts from previous class sessions. I believe the \"bunch of lectures and two big tests\" system that so many professors in this program seem to implement simply isn't conducive to learning. People tend to learn best with lots of opportunities for success and failure that present important concepts to them again and again in a variety of situations. Having two large tests that comprise so much of a grade simply incentivizes students to cram and forget, instead of pushing them to exercise and internalize. I'd also acknowledge that the \"bunch of lectures and two big tests\" system is certainly easier on professors who may be carrying a large course load. Crafting a flipped course, or one with more focused and exercise-based material, is no small task. But the frequency of this model in the St. Thomas grad software program is disheartening - especially at $3,400 per class. So while I don't fault Prof. Kazamzadeh for being another in a long line of professors who run a class in the \"read, lecture, pass two massive tests\" style, it's frustrating that I'm writing a review like this once again.", "meta": {"filename": "201940SEIS631-01.txt", "linenum": 1}}

When attempting to answer student questions, they are rarely resolved and often include the phrase \"google that.\" He has admitted his primary coding language is python so he sometimes doesn't code right in R or will spend copious amounts of time talking about how you could code it in python when the class is about R. Abe also did not adequately prepare for the semester because he put up the syllabus and shared it with the bookstore, but on the first night of class realized he put the wrong copy of the book in the syllabus which many of us had already purchased.

I have no doubt that relying on the book's direction/path for the course would definitely suffice for what the course is trying to achieve but if it can be customized to fit the overall program would be even better. My only comment about the course (not on Abe particularly) is the use of the R language. I'm sure it is a great statistical software but I would have liked to use python with the course for the purpose of consistency, proficiency, and logical progression from requiring students to go through Python as a pre-requisite, taking the foundations in data analysis, machine-learning, up to the artificial intelligence course. I understand R or python (or any other software) are just tools and regardless of the tools used, the goal of the course is to gain knowledge and understanding in the foundations of statistics. However, I feel that proficiency in the use of the software by using it all through-out the program is just as important. I think the big head-scratcher (at least for me) is why would the SEIS 631 course require SEIS 603 when python is not even used at all in SEIS631?", "meta": {"filename": "201940SEIS631-03.txt", "linenum": 2}}

It got better as we went into Tableau as the handouts were a little easier to follow and it was a more intuitive platform. I do think that final project helps tie things together and gives a better meaning to the course and why I took it. I would also recommend reworking how the lectures are presented. The handouts are definitely helpful, but I went through them again line by line after the lecture to help with the assignments. So it seemed like a bit of a waste to spend half our class time going step by step through the handouts. Maybe it would be more helpful to go over different examples than what's included in the handout.

He understands that we are all busy people, coming in with different backgrounds, and clearly worked hard to make sure we all learned something. He was transparent that it was his first time teaching this course, and I could imagine a few changes to improve it. I would have preferred that our weekly break out sessions were with a consistent group of people, so that we could have the opportunity to get to know our classmates better. Depending on the combination of students, sometimes the break out room conversations were interesting, but I think that small group time would have been better served doing hands-on exercises together instead of discussing the textbook. Actually, overall I wish there was much more hands-on work and less textbook review. In our careers we need to have the skills more than we need to know the vocabulary. If I didn't already know SQL I'm not sure I would have come away from this course being able to execute a medium complexity query, which I think should be a goal outcome. I thought the final project was great, and the open-ended description allowed us all to choose our own adventure based on our interests and background knowledge. I think we could have started the final project even earlier in the term and ideally had a round of feedback from Abe during the process. The decision to have us prerecord the project presentations was truly brilliant. Saved lots of presentation anxiety, potential for technical difficulties, and ensured (hopefully) that everyone comes in under 5 min! Abe utilized the virtual learning tools very well, I appreciated the organized Canvas course, the class announcements, and the discussions. I thought it worked well to share with OneDrive even if students had a strangely hard time remembering to make the links actually be links! Next term, I'd suggest adding a short break or two during classes, letting us get to know our small groups, and reducing the percentage of lectures and increasing the amount of hands on exercises (all of these things would also encourage cameras on, since it would be less passive).

I have a BS in computer science, but I don\u2019t really interact with databases at a detail level in my career. I think this course did a decent job of covering a wide array of database topics; maybe too wide. So of the discussion on how to install various tools and applications that we did not actually wind up using seemed like a poor use of time. There should have been much more homework, especially hands on work. I felt like there was very little practice to learn from our mistakes. The semester started out with a lot of hands-on work, jumping directly into doing a large volume of SQL statements. I was enthused; it was actually FUN! We got immediate feedback with either being rewarded with a result of our query, or an error that we then needed to research and keep trying until it worked. Later, as we were working through some very, very long chapters in the book, there was little hands on. I feel like there should have been assignments for every class session. The book was not exclusively, but highly focused on Microsoft SQL Server and not Oracle. I get it that Oracle may be highly prominent in the industry and certainly a good employment skill for students, it was a bit frustrating to have a textbook that leaned towards MS and the work was 100% Oracle. The breakout rooms did not seem very valuable to me, mainly because we did not always have a lot to talk about. This brings me back to more frequent homework. If we had assignments for each class, then the breakouts would have held more value to discuss the problems and outcomes. Also, I think if we had more static breakout groups we would have grown together and been able to converse more. Understand the value of mixing it up, so a compromise could be what I have had in other classes: 1 static group prior to midterm and then we get new teams for 2nd half of semester. And to take that one step further, I think that it would have been really interesting if the final project was a team project. This would have been more \u201creal world\u201d to create the problem solution as a team since that is how people would do it on the job. Many of my other GPS classes have had team midterm and final projects. It allows each person to use their strengths and learn from the others, especially with getting feedback. \u201cHands On\u201d segments at the end of class were really an instructor demo. There was not the time, prepared instructions, or ability to multitask with watching what was happening in the demo and try to replicate it at the same time. Plus they were always at the very end and we often went over the class end time. This course, with 3 sections and lot of material, seems like it could be a good candidate for a Flipped Course format, with the lectures pre-recorded and the class sessions reserved for exercises, team work on projects, questions to the professor, etc. It would certainly cut down on the need to repeat the lecture 3 nights a week.

I feel that the survey assignment was a create way to incorporate our data into creating tables and modifying tables. I liked the concepts of the other assignments moving closer to the final project. I appreciate the \"chose your own adventure\" final project approach. I feel that this does give students more of an option to explore areas they are interested in.

I am sure this is also different because online (which I took this section because it was offered online), but most of the members of my assigned breakout groups did not actually talk, work collaboratively, or even engage past the first group assignment. I understand the goal of what the breakout groups was aiming for, but I don't think it was a productive use of time all of the time. It may be nice to have a few more breaks.

{"text": "Professor Kazemzadeh is definitely knowledgeable in this subject, however he might make a better professor for undergraduate versus graduate level students. While he's very nice and patient and takes the time to listen to students, often he will get distracted and go on a tangent about something that is deeper than where we are in the class/level of understanding for most students. This then creates a ripple effect where class goes past 9pm which can be frustrating since most of us work full time jobs prior to class, it's important to respect our time as well and end class as scheduled. he in class hands-on activities also seem unstructured and in the end don't prepare us for the homework/final project. I think the class needs a better balance of lecture versus hands-on activities rather than just rushing through it at the end of class. We spent more time doing work in OracleDataModeler in one class than it felt like we did of database creation/querying, even though Professor kept saying it's more important to be comfortable and capable querying than building models, I felt we could have gotten deeper on writing complex queries which would be more beneficial.", "meta": {"filename": "202220SEIS630-01.txt", "linenum": 8}}

{"text": "The software for the most important part the ANALYTICS is outdated, not asked about in interviews or wanted on job boards. The tableau was not deep enough to make any difference in getting a job the data was too small to say you figured anything out. The prof is smart and could be teaching a class that is useful as a data scientist that would help us get a job. This class was a waste of my money and as a for-profit college trying to teach something you have failed again.

{"text": "Honestly, I was disappointed in the course. I was hoping to have more hands-on learning and real-world application of data analytics and visualization topics. Need to go through the in-class hands-on exercises in SAS EM and Tableau slower. I got lost a few times and had a hard time catching up. Also, I wished there would have been more exercises/assignments using Tableau. I feel that I could have learned more about Tableau by reading a book and working through exercises on my own. The data analytics portion should be taught using R instead of SAS as I feel R is more of a marketable skill than SAS EM is. The two parts of the class (analytics and visualization) should be broken out into separate classes in order to go more in depth. It was difficult to be engaged during the class lectures. Maybe it's part of being in the Saturday class but, especially by the afternoon, it was hard to just sit and listen and look at lecture slides. There was a lot of conceptual material, which was helpful, but terms weren't adequately defined which made it difficult to learn and comprehend. There needed to be more of a hands-on component.

I think the only issue I would have with Abe is that occasionally class ends up going long, and normally only by 5-10 minutes but when class is already 3 hours long and ending at 9 PM, it would be highly preferred to always end on time. The times it has been the most frustrating is when going over the homework that is due the next week and spending excess time talking though it instead of letting the student(s) do the homework on their own.
