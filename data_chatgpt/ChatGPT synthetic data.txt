Professor Jenkins is super passionate about the material, but sometimes goes off-topic.
Would love more structured lectures.


Dr. Patel, thank you for always staying after class to answer our questions.
It made a huge difference!


Mr. Thompson’s lectures are clear and well-paced. 
Wish he incorporated more real-world examples, though.


I found Ms. Lee’s class disorganized and confusing. 
The syllabus changed twice mid-semester.


Dr. Nguyen is one of the best instructors I’ve had—she made a difficult subject feel manageable and even fun.


Class with Professor Carter was okay. 
Nothing exceptional, but nothing terrible either.


Loved the energy Mrs. Alvarez brings to class! 
Her enthusiasm is contagious.


Mr. Brown, your slides are too text-heavy. 
Please try to engage us more in discussion.


Dr. Simmons really cares about her students. 
She even remembered everyone’s names by week two.


Professor Chang grades harshly but fairly. 
You’ll learn a lot if you put in the work.


I didn’t feel like I learned much in Mr. Garcia’s class. 
The lectures were repetitive, and the assignments felt rushed.


Dr. O'Malley explains things clearly, but her feedback on assignments is vague.


Professor Chen is incredibly knowledgeable, but sometimes talks too fast for non-native speakers.


Ms. Kim, thank you for being so approachable and understanding when I needed an extension.


Professor Wallace has a dry sense of humor that grows on you. 
Give him a chance!


Dr. Mehta was okay, but compared to my other classes this term, hers was the least engaging.


I appreciate how Mr. Adams ties in current events with class content. 
Makes things feel relevant.


Mrs. Rivera creates a supportive environment, especially for students who are new to the subject.


The class was boring. 
Dr. Harrison just read off the slides most of the time.


Professor Smith, your passion is admirable, but the course organization could use some improvement.


Ms. Johnson gives great examples and analogies. 
She made abstract ideas easy to grasp.


Didn’t vibe with Mr. Franklin’s teaching style. 
Too rigid and not open to feedback.


Professor Dorsey was very helpful during office hours, even if her lectures were a bit dry.


Dr. Allen, please give us more feedback on how to improve our writing—"good job" isn't enough.


Professor Bennett is hilarious and keeps things light while still covering everything we need.


I expected more from Dr. Tanaka. 
The class felt like a repeat of material I already knew.


Mrs. Clarke, thank you for creating such a welcoming classroom. 
I always felt safe speaking up.


I struggled in Professor Romero’s class. 
He doesn’t explain things clearly unless you already understand the basics.


Mr. Sinclair made statistics actually fun! 
Never thought I’d say that.


Dr. Fields was not very responsive over email, which made group projects difficult to coordinate.
