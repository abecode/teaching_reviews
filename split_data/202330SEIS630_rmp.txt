After reading all of the other reviews on here, I was really worried about this professor before taking his course, but trust me you have nothing to worry about.
His lectures are a little dry, and he sometimes gets confused, but he is a great guy and the class isn't too hard.
He is very receptive to feedback as well.

Great class with a solid mixture of foundational database subjects from design to coding in SQL.
Exercises from readings are done in Oracle.
Reading is critical to this course.
Professor mixes in relevant database happenings throughout lectures as well as created a steady build up to final project on database related subject student chooses.

Abe is a great Professor.
He is very helpful.
It was my first database class and I did learn a lot of things from this class.
We saw also some NoSql databases languages in the Class.
Now, I am really good at the Oracle SQL.
I also took from Java Foundation first from him.
It was also great.

I had Abe a year ago for a different class and thought his teaching style had improved quite a bit since then.
One forever annoyance though is him spending class time to help individuals troubleshoot their database/program/etc.
Sometimes he'll spend over an hour doing this!

Pretty good professor overall.
Learned a lot about databases, SQL, and database management.
Created my own hobby database on Oracle Cloud because I felt confident in my abilities from this class.
