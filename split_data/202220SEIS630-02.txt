I really enjoyed learning from Abe this semester.
It is very, very clear that he has a wealth of knowledge both on the direct subject matter of databases but also just software engineering as a whole.
Abe is always willing to spend extra time answering questions for students and going over difficult topics.  
I think the only issue I would have with Abe is that occasionally class ends up going long, and normally only by 5-10 minutes but when class is already 3 hours long and ending at 9 PM, it would be highly preferred to always end on time.
The times it has been the most frustrating is when going over the homework that is due the next week and spending excess time talking though it instead of letting the student(s) do the homework on their own.
Overall, I think Abe is a great professor and I really enjoyed him.

Thanks for presenting us this class throughout the semester, prof. Abe!

Excellent teaching, Professor was always helpful, always made the class interactive though class was online.

I think the administrative and curricular aspects of the course are very well organized and present clear expectations.
I also think the professor wants to teach an effective course and it shows.
However I think the traditional lecture format is not a great pairing with his delivery style and the course could be made more effective by creating a more hands on coding environment for the students during the time.

I would have preferred to take this course in an in person setting.
I felt the virtual format made it more difficult for me to engage with the course material.
