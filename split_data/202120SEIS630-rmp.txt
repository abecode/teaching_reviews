This prof is super passive aggressive, even more passive aggressive than me positing this here anonymously!
I don't recommend!

He is fine for chit chatting after class.
Really awful as far as teaching is concerned.
Dont even ask him questions.
He makes up some random answers that are completely wrong.

first time teaching this course
and it showed.
class had a wide range of knowledge which may have created the environment i was in but man was it a slog to get through.
quizzes were based off the book.
focusing on reading a book and not require any hands on work for the most part is not what a database class should be.
i didn't learn much.

If u ask him about video editing or boat sailing, he will passionately chat with u. U ask him anything from the course and he has no answer.
So I asked this guy difference between transactions in RDBMS and NoSQL systems.
His reply was "every database company is different and you should call their customer support to know the differences".
LOL :)

Does not know anything beyond the powerpoint slides he reads through.
Even those slides are some other professors and not his own so clearly he has no idea.
Moreover, during my office hour questions he used to google search for answers and asked me to do the same.

He uses his slides of other professors and reads through.
If you ask a question he almost never knows the answers and gives a very vague tangential rant.
Boring as hell.
I am not learning anything from Abe.
He tries to act nice and he might be nice but that doesnt help.
Waste.
