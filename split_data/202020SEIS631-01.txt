Given the difficulty of transitioning to distance learning, I think this class went well.
I found the flipped lecture format to be surprisingly effective.

This was one of the best classes I ever took.
professor Abe is one of the best I ever learned from.
He is humble and eager to teach no matter how long or hard it took teach me.
I would ask him questions and he would stay almost for another hour helping me out.
I would definitely recommend students to take his classes.
