I am not sure if this department even checks before they hire instructors anymore.
I graduated from this program in the 90s when they had some fantastic instructors and came back to a grad certificate now.
My first course was with Abe and it was a big disapointment.
Knows nothing about what he is teaching and to over compensate acts too friendly

He's as articulate as a person with an accent but doesn't have an accent.
And theres essay questions on the test.
In an analytics class.
Weird.
His slides are a mess and hard to follow.
I'd learn more if he huffed dry erase and did interpretive dance for 3 hours a week.
Strange rictuals that the society/tribe make you go through.
Weird.

He discussed his research on presidential election data.
Met him in his office.
He tried to explain how everyone should be waiting democratic.
I did not sign up for a lecture on politics.
Weird.

Abe is kind of a guy you would hire to baby sit your kids at home, overly friendly.
However is a useless instructore.
Lectures are unstructured, explanations are vague, irrelevant made up examples, and a worthless class project that everyone had to do.

Talks about too many examples without even explaining them.
You basically have to try and teach yourself with all the notes.
If u ask him a question, he always goes off topic and gives a vague answer that he is unsure about - something like "yes sometimes that can happen although it depends I dont know that may not happen as well" .
