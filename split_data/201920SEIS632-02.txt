I learned a lot from this class.
Lectures are long and it is too much information to digest.
I think one thing that can improve this class is to organize/simplify the lectures to make it as easy as possible to understand/read.
Maybe, even filter the information down to what is most important to know.

I really gained a lot of useful skills/knowledge about creating visualizations and am very happy about that.
I felt that the machine learning content was a little rushed, but understand the desire to have that as part of the course curriculum.
Initially I though it would have been better to expand the time given to the machine learning part, but in retrospect, the visualization content is so useful that I wouldn't want to give it less time.
I liked the individual projects a lot, but I think if they are individual projects we should probably present them as such rather than group presentations.
One takeaway from our class presentation is we need a hard time limit and a timer to keep presentations from being too long.

Wish we had spent more time on using Tableau and SAS Enterprise Miner to convey more statistical analysis related data.
Also use Tableau to do table joins and other data cleansing and merging technics.
Overall learned a lot from this course and the professor was incredibly generous with his time and put a lot of effort into making the course easy to understand.

The course is too lengthy for the class duration.
Practical lectures on SAS ERM or Tableau not both with the theory part.
I think because of this issue the professor tried hard to make the course as smooth as possible.
They're was too much that had to be covered in a 3 hour class, 70% of the classes weren't able to finish what was planned to be covered in them.
