He is a good guy, responds quickly, and makes sure to take time to answer questions.
He also goes out of his way to make sure people know what's expected for tests/assignments, and are following along.
In general, his lectures are pretty dull and he lacks deep expertise about the subject.

Thank you Professor!

Great course taught by a fantastic professor.
Always very attentive and understanding.
Highly recommended.

Great teacher with lots of information.
Course started off shaking in my opinion as I thought that it was just about SQL, but got more interesting as the course went on.
I would maybe suggest using MS SQL, I think it is far superior to Oracle (Oracle Live was very glitchy for me), but I understand there maybe license issues

- Three hour lectures with one break was challenging to stay focused.
Perhaps more frequent breaks might be helpful.

It would have been helpful to have more focus on sql queries themselves for data preparation.

Professor K. really cares about *_teaching_*
the subject matter.
Unlike some professors, he seems like he wants his students to understand, rather than just perform.
I'd definitely take another class with him again, if it fit my curriculum.

Dr. Kazemzadeh is a very knowledgable and easygoing professor.
He explains concepts in detail and is an approachable person outside of class hours.
He is also very open to and encourages questions and discussion during the lecture.
I also liked the structure of the course as I felt I was able to learn and succeed based on how we were evaluated.
I experienced a positive learning experience and will apply the material from this course into my future endeavors.
