Great professor with a LOT of potential (on top of his current talents).
He is very down to Earth and fair, and I am happy to have taken the course with him as the teacher.
I look forward to seeing how his teaching methods produce the future of data-scientists!

Abe is very knowledgeable however needs to work on his lecturing.
The lectures are very dry and boring, and hard to listen to.
The lectures were not very interactive, and some parts I had no idea why we were doing things, or what purpose certain tests served.
The slides did not provide much info so was very hard to study from as well.
I think with some practice and more interactiveness in the class instead of just sitting listening to lecture for 3 hours would help with the class to be more interesting.
