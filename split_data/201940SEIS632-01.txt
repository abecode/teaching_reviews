I think having the hands-on activities at beginning of class helps ensure that we have enough time to get through the handouts, and also keeps attention better.
I found the hands-on activities useful, especially Tableau.

The lectures were too long.
This is the first graduate level class I have taken at UST where the professor lectured the entire class for almost every class.
That being said, Abe did a great job in his lectures using real-life examples and an easy-to-follow format.
Consistent due dates each week on homework and quizzes would be very helpful in this class.
Enterprise Minor is a difficult software to use and I commend Abe's efforts on teaching us in this software.
It would be great if UST could find a software that is more widely-used and easier to use for this class (I would have been willing to pay money to use better software).

This course is highly disorganized, and the structure of the final project seems nearly useless for evaluating student learning, as it depends too significantly on the process of finding and organizing a meaningful data set rather than the analytics and visualization of the title.
I don't feel this class meaningfully prepared me to use the technology, or to understand the concepts, as too much time was spent acquiring usable data.
