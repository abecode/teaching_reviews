Abe is a practical, passionate, and thoughtful teacher who knows how to balance between making sure that students are learning the material and getting fair grades. My only feedback is that the class seems to be covering a lot of materials, 3 hours and 15 mins don't seem enough to cover it all, at some point by the end of each class most students check out and it became just a matter of being there, maybe a better distribution of class activity will be helpful, more peer interaction and cut back on some of the material or demand that student read three pages which covers the basics of each day's class before they come to the class.
Professor Abe was an absolute blessing to have as we transitioned to online learning. He was approachable, funny, and so helpful in anything that we needed.
Great and understanding instructor who handled the difficulties well throughout the semester.
