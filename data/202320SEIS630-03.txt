I like Abe a lot but sometimes the class feels very unorganized. Also, sometimes he doesn't have great time management and will spend way too much class time helping 1 or 2 people troubleshoot their problems. In the future he should really just tell people to talk to him after class instead of spending 30-60 minutes during class on it. He is a fair grader and very helpful so I would definitely take another class from him again.
Awesome professor, appreciated the flexibility and availability.
the class is very slow. It might be nice to have more mandatory (graded, even just for completion) hands on assignments and projects throughout the semester. I think it'd be nice if a larger segment of class time was hands on projects and smaller segment being the lecturing. Not poorly taught, just far too easy and slow to be engaging.
This was was amazing. Learned a lot. Thanks a lot professor!
I have learned many a things from your course. Thank you for your hardwork and for explaining concepts more clearly. I really appreciate it!
Thank you so much for your well prepared lectures. I always enjoy following your hand-on activity after each lecture and I appreciate how approachable you are.
Professor Abe made class enjoyable since you can tell he is passionate about the subject. He provided ways to make the learning interactive and related it to real life events. Overall this class was very enjoyable and I learned alot more about oracle and other databases which will help in my current job!
Very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject taught. Real world examples and other topics were brought to class which helped showcase class related topics. It's evident that there is care and effort brought to every class and questions answered.
