Passive aggressive, did not help, told me I would fail the class without giving any solution. Was lost during class. You should not take this class. I say it for your own good.
Avoid at all costs. Abe seems like a nice guy, but you will teach yourself everything in this course, he confuses himself. He stumbles and stutters through topics. You can do the reading, read through the slides, and then get to class and he will take everything you learned and throw it out the window. Worthless.
Do not recommend! This professor does not care about you learning the material. The lectures did not match up with what was needed for the exams. Take this class from Professor Ann instead. I have heard she is good.
