I really liked his teaching approach. He takes attention to what his students suggest and also checks if the students understood what he taught. He is also a nice human being.
Prof Abe is great. He taught us many statistics knowledge, used many latest dataset during our class, adapted flip teaching method. He is very nice, and professional for any questions from student. Thanks Abe
Adapted very well to the challenges of transitioning to online learning, encouraged participation and was always open and responsive to questions. Sought out his section for a future registered class because his style works well for me and I appreciate his dedication. Great first class and professor to have for my program.
This course was difficult to follow along with as the tests and lectures didn't seem to correspond with the homework. Alot of the work we did that was graded was not what we were tested on which led to a lot of confusion and many adjustments after the tests were graded. I felt the communication was a little lacking as much as of it wasn't available on canvas and was done through the lectures which made it hard to reference back to. I think our professor was knowledgable and super nice but that the class as a whole had to drive most of the discussion and routinely ask for clarification on each assignment and each topic.
Abe is very friendly, understanding and knowledgeable! I enjoyed this class alot even during COVID-19!
