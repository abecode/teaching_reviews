The Assignments and Grading system is really good. It's more focused towards learning aspects rather then just the grading criteria. Good teaching methods by professor.
His java background seem not that much great.I think he has good background in pythoton so its better assign mastered instructor for this course
Abe was well-informed in this area of study and did a great job focusing on the code itself as well as other peripheral information that enhances a student's knowledge about programming / computer science. There were some times in class when we dove deep into something that I didn't have questions on so it felt a little bit like an unnecessary use of class time. (3 evening hours every week is a long time away from my family and I want to always be getting high value return from that time) But I suppose it was helpful to to hear others discuss the code/lecture and learn new perspectives in that way.
The class structure was pretty good. I though it was a good choice to a final project over a final exam. The topics were interest although towards the end, the readings were somewhat long.
The professor is good and responsible.
I really appreciate Dr. Kazemzadeh's approach to this course and the topic material. I felt like there was a good balance between different types of evaluations (quizzes, videos, etc.). Dr. Kazemzadeh was approachable and helpful in answering questions.
I did enjoy the quizzes that we had to take. They weren't too easy or too difficult, but a good challenge to see where I am at.
