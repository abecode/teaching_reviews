Really good course. I like the exercises and the use of homework, project and quizes vs. final exam. I actually would have like more homework with specific use cases (build a database to meet this need, etc.)
The ability to inform and state clearly that Oracle taught in class would be a little different from other Database Management systems and showing use cases was eye-opening. Great lecture and progress made understanding databases and their systems.
I learned few new topics from this class and everything was good!
Great guy, but not the best at explaining database concepts. Using more plain language to explain difficult concepts would be helpful, as well as more examples and writing more on the board to provide visual examples. The Venn diagrams and normalization exercise were great, and I think he should do more of them!
